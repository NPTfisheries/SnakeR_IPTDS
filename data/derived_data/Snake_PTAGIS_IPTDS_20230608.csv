Each antenna is powered by a Biomark Multiplexing Reader IS1001-MC master controller.  The antennas were built and installed by WDFW.  The electrical power at the site is provided by 6 200 watt solar panels.   Data currently will be downloaded by Biomark through a satellite modem. No environmental monitors are installed at this time. This site has variously consisted of one or two groups of arrays, about a kilometer apart, located near the mouth of the Tucannon River.  From Oct. 2005 until April 2008 the downstream array group consisted of two tandem ""log"" antenna arrays that spanned the low-water channel above the boat ramp.  The upstream array group was located at an abandoned railroad bridge abutment upstream of Hwy 261 on the Tucannon River downstream from Starbuck.  The upstream array (A0) operated from Oct. 2005 until January 2009.  Its various configurations included both pass-through and pass-over antennas.  A single array (C0) with six PVC pipe antennas powered by a QST Qube was re-deployed above the boat ramp in Sept. 2009.  Responsibility for site operations transferred from USFWS to WDFW on Jan. 7, 2010.  The C0 in-stream array was relocated below the Hwy 261 bridge on Sept. 29, 2010.
