# SnakeR_IPTDS

`SnakeR_IPTDS` is a Git repository to maintain, display, and distribute information on instream PIT tag detection systems (IPTDS) throughout the Snake River basin. Sites include all IPTDS registered with [PTAGIS](https://www.ptagis.org/Sites/InterrogationSites) plus a small number of adult fishways. The repo includes an [interactive R Shiny map](https://nptfisheries.shinyapps.io/sr-iptds/) perhaps useful for IPTDS prioritization efforts.
